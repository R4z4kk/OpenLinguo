# @openlinguo/data-pipeline

Downloads datasets from pinned URLs, verifies them against the sha256 recorded in `data/manifest.json`, and writes compact shards to `data/<dataset>/`. Raw sources are kept in memory and never written to the repository.

```bash
pnpm --filter @openlinguo/data-pipeline pipeline cc-cedict
```

- Without `--refresh`, a dataset whose upstream file changed fails with a checksum mismatch. Nothing is rebuilt.
- With `--refresh`, the new checksum and retrieval date are pinned and the shards rebuilt. The result goes through a reviewed pull request; it is never merged automatically.
- `data/<dataset>/` is fully generated (shards and attribution README); do not edit it by hand.
